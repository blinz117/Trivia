# Trivia
A simple trivia question app this is mostly meant as a place for me to experiment and learn new things. 
Whether or not the app is architectued well or even really functional oe is sort of besides the point other than in the capactiy that it allows me the capacity to try things on it in a semi-realistic scenario.
